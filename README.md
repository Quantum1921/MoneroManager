# MoneroManager

Use this windows program to safely view the balance of your Monero wallet:

1) Select the location of your Monero command line wallet .exe (one time only)
2) Select the location of your wallet key file (one time only)
3) Dial in the password - keyboard logger and malware resistent password entry

MoneroManager brings up your command line wallet, shows you the balance 
and then shuts down the wallet exe.
